# KT - Karen's Ticketing

KT - Karen's Ticketing is an on-chain ticketing solution.

- Users own their tickets and can resell them. For example if they can't attend or if they can resell it for a profit.
- Event organizers get a decentralized infrastructure for the ticketing, can define resell rules and earn royalties on resell profits.

This project was created as part of ETH Global Brussels in 2024.

## Setup
